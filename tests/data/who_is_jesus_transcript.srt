00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,200
Today we're asking the question at the very center of the Christian faith, who is Jesus,

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,759
according to his own words in the Bible.

3
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:12,800
This is not just a matter of opinion, it is a matter of eternal life or death.

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:19,199
It's the line between the Creator and the creature, between the Kingdom of God and the Kingdoms of this world.

5
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:24,640
The Bible says that in the fullness of time, the eternal Son of God took on human flesh.

6
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:29,760
Before he was born in Bethlehem, he existed forever, sharing the same divine nature as God,

7
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,200
the Father, and the Holy Spirit. He is the maker of heaven and earth.

8
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,159
Everything was created through him, and everything holds together because of him.

9
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:43,439
And yet he stepped into his own creation, not as a distant ruler, but as a real man,

10
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:48,240
born into a humble Jewish family in Bethlehem, in Israel, under Roman occupation.

11
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:52,880
People could count his years on earth, but his divine life had no beginning and will have no end.

12
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,920
Jesus was not just a wise teacher or a prophet.

13
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:01,680
The Bible also calls him the Christ, the Greek word from Asiah, which means God's promised and

14
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,680
chosen Savior. The one promised to deliver his people from their sins.

15
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:12,640
When he said, before Abraham was, I am. He was claiming the very name of God revealed to Moses.

16
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:17,680
The prophet said promised a king who would reign forever, called mighty God and Prince of Peace.

17
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:22,000
In Jesus, those promises came true, not partially, but completely.

18
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,280
When Jesus called God his Father in a unique way, he was declaring that he is equal with God.

19
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,920
That was not arrogance, it was truth. The Creator had taken on the nature of his creation,

20
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,319
without ever ceasing to be God. The Bible calls this the incarnation,

21
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:39,359
not man ascending to God, but God descending to man.

22
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:45,519
The eternal word became flesh. He knew what it was to be hungry, thirsty, tired, and deeply

23
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:48,719
moved with compassion. And yet, he never sinned.

24
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,959
Sin is breaking God's perfect standard for how we are to live.

25
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:59,439
As Jesus explained in his own words, to love God with all our heart, soul, mind, and strength,

26
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:04,159
and to love others as ourselves. We have all failed to do this, and because of that,

27
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:09,120
we stand guilty before him, deserving not only physical death, but spiritual and eternal separation

28
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:13,919
from God. This is why Jesus came to save us from sin and reconcile us to God.

29
00:02:14,559 --> 00:02:20,000
Every one of us, represented by the first man Adam, has sinned in this way. Our sin has separated

30
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,839
us from our Creator, and no one but the God-man could bridge that infinite gap. Why only Jesus?

31
00:02:25,839 --> 00:02:30,799
Because the gap between a holy God and sinful humanity is not just moral, it is infinite.

32
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:36,639
No mere human could perfectly live according to God's standard, and no one but Jesus has done this

33
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:41,679
without failure. And no one but Jesus could bear the full weight of God's righteous judgment,

34
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:47,520
and then rise victorious over death. The Bible makes it clear that only one who is truly righteous

35
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:53,280
can stand in the place of the guilty. Jesus confirmed this when he said, I am the way and the truth

36
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:59,360
and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. In all of history, only Jesus is

37
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:05,760
both fully God, able to bear the infinite cost and fully man, able to represent us. No one is

38
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:11,439
saved by their own works, good intentions, or religious efforts. The Bible says, by grace you have

39
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:16,879
been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing, it is the gift of God, not a result of

40
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:22,479
works, so that no one may boast. Our hope rests entirely on what Jesus has done, not on what we have

41
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:27,919
done. On the cross, under the authority of the Roman governor Pontius Pilate, Jesus was sentenced

42
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:33,520
to death and crucified, a brutal form of execution reserved for the worst criminals in the Roman Empire.

43
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:39,199
Yet this was no accident of history. The Romans carried it out, but it was according to the definite

44
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:45,359
plan and foreknowledge of God. In that moment, Jesus bore the full weight of God's wrath against sin.

45
00:03:45,359 --> 00:03:51,359
He was not forced there by chance or injustice. He gave his life willingly. He was carrying out the

46
00:03:51,359 --> 00:03:56,799
plan the Father had made before the foundation of the world to save us from sin and reconcile us to God.

47
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:02,879
As the Bible says, for God so loved the world that he gave his only son, that whoever believes in

48
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:08,239
him should not perish but have eternal life. And then, on the third day, he rose from the grave.

49
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:13,520
The resurrection was not just a symbol of hope. It was the final victory over death.

50
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:18,240
The proof that every claim he made was true, and the declaration that his sacrifice for us was

51
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:24,400
accepted by God. It showed that the penalty for sin, which God's word declares his death,

52
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:30,079
had been paid in full for all who trust in him. Today, Jesus reigns at the right hand of the Father.

53
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:36,400
He is not waiting to be king. He is king now. From his throne, he rules over all creation and

54
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:41,919
continues his work in the lives of his people through the Holy Spirit. As he promised his disciples,

55
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:46,959
I will not leave you as orphans. I will come to you. He has kept that promise by sending the Holy

56
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:52,719
Spirit to dwell within all who belong to him. He gives us new desires that align with God's will,

57
00:04:52,719 --> 00:04:58,159
transforms our patterns of thinking, and renews our minds so that we may have the mind of Christ.

58
00:04:58,159 --> 00:05:04,479
He leads us to walk in obedience, strengthens us in trials, and conforms us to his image day by day,

59
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:10,160
and one day every knee will bow before him, either enjoy and faith or in fear and judgment.

60
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:15,200
But his reign now is only the beginning of what he will accomplish. The Bible promises that one

61
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:20,640
day Jesus will return in glory, not in humility, to judge the living and the dead. He will raise his

62
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:25,360
people to eternal life, wipe away every tear, and bring in the new heavens and the new earth

63
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:30,879
where God's righteousness dwells. For those who belong to him, the future is filled with unshakable

64
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:36,560
hope. We will see him face to face, be fully freed from sin, and dwell with him forever.

65
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:42,079
So the question is not just who is Jesus. It is who do you say that he is? The Bible says,

66
00:05:42,719 --> 00:05:46,639
if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him

67
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:51,759
from the dead, you will be saved. This saving faith is always joined with repentance,

68
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:56,159
the turning away from sin and self-rule, and the turning toward God in submission and love.

69
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,760
It is the fruit of a new heart that treasures Christ above all.

70
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,800
When you turn to Jesus in repentance and faith, you are not bringing your good deeds to earn his

71
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:10,560
favor. You are trusting fully in his perfect life, his sacrifice on the cross, and his resurrection

72
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:16,400
from the dead. Salvation is not about what you can do for God, but about what God has already

73
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:21,280
done for you in Christ. To turn away from him is to remain under God's righteous judgment.

74
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:26,639
To trust him is to be reconciled to your creator, save from your sin, and welcomed into his

75
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:31,599
eternal kingdom. If you have never trusted in Jesus, I desire with all my heart that you would

76
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:36,319
turn to him today. Believe in him, follow him, and discover the joy of knowing him.

77
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:40,959
He calls you not only to be forgiven, but to walk with him, to enjoy his presence,

78
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:46,159
and to share the good news of his salvation with others. This is the life you were created for,

79
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:52,480
glorify God and to delight in him forever. This is who Jesus is, the eternal Son of God,

80
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:58,400
the image of the invisible God, the Lord over all things, the only Savior for sinners,

81
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,840
the one before whom heaven and earth will one day stand in judgment.

82
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:06,320
If the Spirit of God has touched your heart today, do not ignore his voice.

83
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:12,800
Develop a sincere and intimate relationship with him, and enjoy his perfect and unfailing love.

84
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:17,199
Start by getting to know him, open the Bible, and read the passages we have mentioned

85
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:24,240
in the Gospel of John 8.58. In the Book of Isaiah the Prophet, 9.6.7,

86
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:31,680
in the letter to the Romans, 3.23.24, in the Gospel of John 14.6.18.

87
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:41,759
In the letter to the Ephesians, 2.8.9, in the Gospel of John 3.16, in the letter to the Romans, 10.9.

88
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,319
Read them prayerfully, asking God to open your eyes to the truth of his Word.

89
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:52,959
The Bible declares that the penalty for sin is death, not just physical death, but spiritual

90
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:59,039
and eternal separation from God. Yet in his love, God has provided the only way to be forgiven

91
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:05,519
and reconciled to him through his Son, Jesus Christ. Cry out to him in prayer. Ask him to forgive

92
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:10,879
you for your sin, to give you the grace to repent, to turn away from sin and turn toward him,

93
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:16,639
and to come into your life as your Lord and Savior. Trust fully in what Jesus has done for you.

94
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,279
His perfect life, his death in your place, and his resurrection from the dead,

95
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:29,920
and follow him from this day forward.
