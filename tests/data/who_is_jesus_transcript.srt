1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,759
Today we're asking the question at the very center of the Christian faith, who is Jesus,

2
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:08,099
according to His own words in the Bible.

3
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:13,099
This is not just a matter of opinion, it is a matter of eternal life or death.

4
00:00:13,099 --> 00:00:17,039
It's the line between the Creator and the creature, between the Kingdom of God and the

5
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:19,460
kingdoms of this world.

6
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:25,140
The Bible says that, in the fullness of time, the eternal Son of God took on human flesh.

7
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:29,519
Before He was born in Bethlehem, He existed forever, sharing the same divine nature as

8
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:31,759
God the Father and the Holy Spirit.

9
00:00:31,759 --> 00:00:34,399
He is the Maker of heaven and earth.

10
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:38,519
Everything was created through Him, and everything holds together because of Him.

11
00:00:38,519 --> 00:00:43,600
And yet He stepped into His own creation, not as a distant ruler, but as a real man,

12
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:48,840
born into a humble Jewish family in Bethlehem, in Israel, under Roman occupation.

13
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,299
People could count His years on earth, but His divine life had no beginning and will

14
00:00:52,299 --> 00:00:53,640
have no end.

15
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:56,799
Jesus was not just a wise teacher or a prophet.

16
00:00:56,799 --> 00:01:01,079
The Bible also calls Him the Christ, the Greek word for Messiah, which means God's

17
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:06,859
promised and chosen Savior, the one promised to deliver His people from their sins.

18
00:01:06,859 --> 00:01:12,159
When He said, Before Abraham was, I am, He was claiming the very name of God revealed

19
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:13,640
to Moses.

20
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:17,259
The prophets had promised a king who would reign forever, called Mighty God and Prince

21
00:01:17,259 --> 00:01:18,599
of Peace.

22
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:22,879
In Jesus those promises came true, not partially, but completely.

23
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:26,519
When Jesus called God His Father in a unique way, He was declaring that He is equal with

24
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:27,560
God.

25
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,879
That was not arrogance, it was truth.

26
00:01:29,879 --> 00:01:34,280
The Creator had taken on the nature of His creation without ever ceasing to be God.

27
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:39,119
The Bible calls this the Incarnation, not man ascending to God, but God descending to

28
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:40,679
man.

29
00:01:40,679 --> 00:01:42,679
The Eternal Word became flesh.

30
00:01:42,679 --> 00:01:47,560
He knew what it was to be hungry, thirsty, tired, and deeply moved with compassion.

31
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:50,280
And yet He never sinned.

32
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:54,299
Sin is breaking God's perfect standard for how we are to live.

33
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:59,700
As Jesus explained in His own words, to love God with all our heart, soul, mind, and strength,

34
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,179
and to love others as ourselves.

35
00:02:02,179 --> 00:02:06,219
We have all failed to do this, and because of that we stand guilty before Him, deserving

36
00:02:06,219 --> 00:02:10,680
not only physical death, but spiritual and eternal separation from God.

37
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:14,960
This is why Jesus came to save us from sin and reconcile us to God.

38
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:19,139
Every one of us, represented by the first man Adam, has sinned in this way.

39
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:22,979
Our sin has separated us from our Creator, and no one but the God-man could bridge that

40
00:02:22,979 --> 00:02:24,659
infinite gap.

41
00:02:24,659 --> 00:02:26,280
Why only Jesus?

42
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:31,659
Because the gap between a holy God and sinful humanity is not just moral, it is infinite.

43
00:02:31,659 --> 00:02:36,299
No mere human could perfectly live according to God's standard, and no one but Jesus has

44
00:02:36,299 --> 00:02:38,459
done this without failure.

45
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:42,399
And no one but Jesus could bear the full weight of God's righteous judgment and then rise

46
00:02:42,399 --> 00:02:44,939
victorious over death.

47
00:02:44,939 --> 00:02:48,560
The Bible makes it clear that only one who is truly righteous can stand in the place

48
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,819
of the guilty.

49
00:02:49,859 --> 00:02:51,780
Jesus confirmed this when He said,

50
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:54,659
I am the way, and the truth, and the life.

51
00:02:54,659 --> 00:02:57,400
No one comes to the Father except through me.

52
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:02,500
In all of history, only Jesus is both fully God, able to bear the infinite cost, and fully

53
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:05,500
man, able to represent us.

54
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:09,900
No one is saved by their own works, good intentions, or religious efforts.

55
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:10,900
The Bible says,

56
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:13,219
By grace you have been saved through faith.

57
00:03:13,219 --> 00:03:17,780
And this is not your own doing, it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that

58
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,400
no one may boast.

59
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:23,520
Our hope rests entirely on what Jesus has done, not on what we have done.

60
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:28,000
On the cross, under the authority of the Roman governor Pontius Pilate, Jesus was sentenced

61
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,599
to death and crucified, a brutal form of execution reserved for the worst criminals in the Roman

62
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:33,599
Empire.

63
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:36,159
Yet this was no accident of history.

64
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:40,400
The Romans carried it out, but it was according to the definite plan and foreknowledge of

65
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,700
God.

66
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:45,879
In that moment, Jesus bore the full weight of God's wrath against sin.

67
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:48,719
He was not forced there by chance or injustice.

68
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:50,520
He gave his life willingly.

69
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:54,560
He was carrying out the plan the Father had made before the foundation of the world, to

70
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,800
save us from sin and reconcile us to God.

71
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,120
As the Bible says,

72
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,360
For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should

73
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,159
not perish but have eternal life.

74
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:09,159
And then, on the third day, he rose from the grave.

75
00:04:09,159 --> 00:04:13,759
The resurrection was not just a symbol of hope, it was the final victory over death,

76
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:18,000
the proof that every claim he made was true, and the declaration that his sacrifice for

77
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,279
us was accepted by God.

78
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:25,160
It showed that the penalty for sin, which God's word declares is death, had been paid

79
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,920
in full for all who trust in him.

80
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:30,920
Today Jesus reigns at the right hand of the Father.

81
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:34,040
He is not waiting to be king, he is king now.

82
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:38,319
From his throne he rules over all creation and continues his work in the lives of his

83
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:40,319
people through the Holy Spirit.

84
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:45,160
As he promised his disciples, I will not leave you as orphans, I will come to you.

85
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:49,960
He has kept that promise by sending the Holy Spirit to dwell within all who belong to him.

86
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:55,080
He gives us new desires that align with God's will, transforms our patterns of thinking,

87
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:58,360
and renews our minds so that we may have the mind of Christ.

88
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:03,379
He leads us to walk in obedience, strengthens us in trials, and conforms us to his image

89
00:05:03,379 --> 00:05:04,720
day by day.

90
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:10,480
And one day every knee will bow before him, either in joy and faith or in fear and judgment.

91
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:14,080
But his reign now is only the beginning of what he will accomplish.

92
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:18,539
The Bible promises that one day Jesus will return in glory, not in humility, to judge

93
00:05:18,539 --> 00:05:20,000
the living and the dead.

94
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,240
He will raise his people to eternal life, wipe away every tear, and bring in the new

95
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,839
heavens and the new earth where God's righteousness dwells.

96
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:31,919
For those who belong to him, the future is filled with unshakable hope.

97
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:36,879
We will see him face to face, be fully freed from sin, and dwell with him forever.

98
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:38,839
So the question is not just, who is Jesus?

99
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:41,519
It is, who do you say that he is?

100
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:42,519
The Bible says,

101
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:16,719
Salvation is not about what you can do for God, but about what God has already done for

102
00:06:16,719 --> 00:06:18,399
you in Christ.

103
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:22,120
To turn away from him is to remain under God's righteous judgment.

104
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:26,659
To trust him is to be reconciled to your Creator, saved from your sin, and welcomed into his

105
00:06:26,659 --> 00:06:28,359
eternal kingdom.

106
00:06:28,359 --> 00:06:32,279
If you have never trusted in Jesus, I desire with all my heart that you would turn to him

107
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:33,279
today.

108
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:37,219
Believe in him, follow him, and discover the joy of knowing him.

109
00:06:37,219 --> 00:06:41,199
He calls you not only to be forgiven but to walk with him, to enjoy his presence, and

110
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:44,279
to share the good news of his salvation with others.

111
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:49,659
This is the life you were created for, to glorify God and to delight in him forever.

112
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:55,339
This is who Jesus is, the eternal Son of God, the image of the invisible God, the Lord over

113
00:06:55,339 --> 00:07:00,719
all things, the only Savior for sinners, the one before whom heaven and earth will one

114
00:07:00,719 --> 00:07:02,680
day stand in judgment.

115
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:07,480
If the Spirit of God has touched your heart today, do not ignore his voice.

116
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:13,220
Help a sincere and intimate relationship with him and enjoy his perfect and unfailing love.

117
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:17,480
Start by getting to know him, open the Bible, and read the passages we have mentioned in

118
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:23,319
the Gospel of John chapter 8 verse 58, in the Book of Isaiah the prophet chapter 9 verses

119
00:07:23,319 --> 00:07:29,520
6 and 7, in the Letter to the Romans chapter 3 verses 23 and 24, in the Gospel of John

120
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:36,500
chapter 14 verses 6 and 18, in the Letter to the Ephesians chapter 2 verses 8 and 9,

121
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:41,620
in the Gospel of John chapter 3 verse 16, in the Letter to the Romans chapter 10 verse

122
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:42,740
9.

123
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:47,800
Read them prayerfully, asking God to open your eyes to the truth of his Word.

124
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:53,019
The Bible declares that the penalty for sin is death, not just physical death but spiritual

125
00:07:53,019 --> 00:07:55,500
and eternal separation from God.

126
00:07:55,500 --> 00:08:00,540
Yet in his love, God has provided the only way to be forgiven and reconciled to him through

127
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:02,899
his Son, Jesus Christ.

128
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:04,899
Cry out to him in prayer.

129
00:08:04,899 --> 00:08:09,620
Ask him to forgive you for your sin, to give you the grace to repent, to turn away from

130
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:14,739
sin and turn toward him, and to come into your life as your Lord and Savior.

131
00:08:14,739 --> 00:08:19,899
Trust fully in what Jesus has done for you, his perfect life, his death in your place,

132
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:23,859
and his resurrection from the dead, and follow him from this day forward.
